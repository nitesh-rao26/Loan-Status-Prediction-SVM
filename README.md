# Loan Status Prediction using SVM

This project predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not based on applicant details using Machine Learning.

## 📊 Dataset
- Applicant income, co-applicant income, loan amount
- Gender, education, marital status, property area, etc.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## 🔍 Workflow
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Label Encoding of Categorical Features
4. Train-Test Split
5. Feature Scaling using StandardScaler
6. Model Training using SVM (Linear Kernel)
7. Model Evaluation using Accuracy Score

## 📈 Results
- Training Accuracy: ~79.8%
- Test Accuracy: ~83.3%

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
- Trying other models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Deploying the model using Flask/Streamlit
